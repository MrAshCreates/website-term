            <p id="description">Hi Danny, Thank you for taking the time to read this message for you.
                When I first met you I never thought that the weird fluid emo kid would end up being someone apart of my life.
                You were one the first people that geunuinely seemed to care about me and who I was.
                This was new for me as I hadn't had many people that ever cared that much about someone they just met. 
                You gave me friendship through my lowest lows and my highest highs. 
                I have seen you grow up to be an amazing friend, and an beautifully pure person. 
                You not only helped give me the childhood I didn't really have but you showed me what a true friendship should be.
                But I have realized you are not a temporary part of my life as you will always be in it.
                I love you danny so so much! Have an Amazing Birthday and enjoy your $30!
            </p>
